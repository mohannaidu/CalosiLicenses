This is a Windows application (a License Manager application) for administration purposes. 
This is a basic app that you can save informations about licenses of each controller in order to manage the licenses better.
The data will be saved on a <i>clever-cloud</i> database for testing purposes but you can also change the database address from the source code.
You can find some informations of the database scheme in the <b>DBInfoImages</b> Folder.
Then There's a testing executable that you can find it under <b>ExeForTesting</b> Folder.
You can find the jar artifact under the <b>out</b> folder. Please note that this program saves the information on a test cloud. 
So if you want to change it and use it privately, make sure to create a similar database and change the database address. 
The UI is based on javafx library and the exe file is created with the launch4j program.
I hope this would be a help for developers around the world.

Hamid.
